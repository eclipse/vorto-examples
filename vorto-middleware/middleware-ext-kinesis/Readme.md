# AWS Kinesis Data Stream Plugin

Publishes Vorto normalized device messages as an [AWS Kinesis Data Stream](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/).

The Kinesis Data stream contains data point records for each mapped Vorto Function Block.

Each records is serialized as JSON. Here is an example of how a record JSON could look like, that is mapped according to a [Temperature Function Block](https://vorto.eclipse.org/#/details/org.eclipse.vorto:Temperature:1.0.0):

```
{
	"payload" : { 
		"value: {
			"currentMeasured" : 30.2
		}
	},
	"modelId" : "org.eclipse.vorto:Temperature:1.0.0",
	"tag" : "indoorTemperature",
	"deviceId" : "4711"
}
```
