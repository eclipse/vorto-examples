# Getting Started with the Eclipse Vorto Semantic Normalizer middleware

**Motivation**

In IoT, devices send their data in various formats to IoT cloud platforms, ie. as JSON, CSV, binary or others. You can imagine, that this requires a lot of integration logic development in the platform, such as preparing the payload in a way, that components can easily process the device messages. 


**What is the Eclipse Vorto Semantic Normalizer middleware?**

The Eclipse Vorto Semantic Normalizer middleware is a lightweight, stateless micro service that normalizes device telemetry messages to a semantic model, that is defined as [Vorto Information Models](https://github.com/eclipse/vorto/blob/master/docs/vortolang-1.0.md). The core of the middleware is the [Vorto Mapping Engine](https://github.com/eclipse/vorto/blob/master/mapping-engine/Readme.md), a tiny runtime component, that applies Vorto Mapping Specifications to the device data, in order to output semantic, normalized data models. Mapping Specifications can be created easily using the [Eclipse Vorto Web Editors](https://vorto.eclipse.org)
The middleware essentially wraps the mapping engine in a spring-boot application, creating a very efficient device telemetry data mapping pipeline.  
In order to customize the middleware to your requirements, an extension point (API) is provided, that lets you easily implement middleware plugins. These plugins are able to process the normalized device payload, such as forwarding it to AWS IoT Shadow Service or a Streaming analytics engine. 

In a micro-service architecture, services communicate asynchronously via AMQP. Therefore, the middleware also uses AMQP technology to receive device messages from Eclipse Hono, and publishes normalized, semantic payload as an AMQP topic. To avoid confusion, the middleware itself, is not an AMQP server, but rather an AMQP client that is able to publish the normalized device messages to any AMQP message broker, e.g. Amazon MQ. 
  
Please follow [this link](https://github.com/eclipse/vorto/blob/development/docs/tutorials/create_mapping_pipeline.md) to use the Vorto Normalizer middleware for a simple IoT geolocation use case.

## Vorto Normalizer Frontend

The Eclipse Vorto Middleware Frontend is an additional lightweight Angular 8 application, which lets you interact with the middleware to do the following:

* **Manage middleware plugins** and their configurations
* **Manage mapping specifications** for device data harmonizations
* **Monitor** inbound and outbound device telemetry messages


You can see a running example of what to expect under [this link](http://vorto-middleware.eu-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/)

# Running the middleware service

  

  

You can run the service out of the box via **Docker**. Thus, getting started is as easy as downloading the container from [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/eclipsevorto/vorto-normalizer) and running it as described in the following:


## **Running the Vorto Normalization Middleware Service**

**Downloading the image:**

1. Pull the image from docker hub:

	 `docker pull eclipsevorto/vorto-normalizer:nightly`

2. Run the image:


**Running the image:**

To run the middleware, you need to set a minimum of the following environment variables:

*  **-e hono.tenantId=**  _Eclipse Hono tenant ID, for receiving device telemetry messages_
*  **-e hono.password=**  _Eclipse Hono messaging password, for receiving device telemetry messages_
*  **-e github.client.clientId=** _Github Client ID credentials, needed to (un)install mapping specifications_
*  **-e github.client.clientSecret=** _Github Client Secret credentials, needed to (un)install mapping specifications_

The middleware comes with 3 built-in plugins, that you can configure for usage. Take a look at the plugins to find out about their environment variables to set:

* [AWS Kinesis Data Stream Plugin](middleware-ext-kinesis/Readme.md) 
* [Eclipse Vorto AMQP Plugin](middleware-ext-amqp/Readme.md)
* [Eclipse Ditto Plugin](middleware-ext-ditto/Readme.md)


Here is an example to start the docker using the [AWS Kinesis plugin](middleware-ext-kinesis/Readme.md):

`docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -e github.client.clientId=your_github_clientid -e github.client.clientSecret=your_github_clientsecret -e hono.tenantId=your_tenantId -e hono.password=your_hono_password -e kinesis.streamName=mystreamName -kinesis.accessKey=mykey -e kinesis.secretKey=mysecret eclipsevorto/vorto-normalizer:nightly`


**Adding your mapping specifications to the middleware**

In order to configure the middleware service with your mapping specifications, you can simply mount a docker volume via `-v` and then point the middleware to this mounted directory, where it can find all mappings. This mounted directory is also used to persist any mapping specifications, that had been installed via the web frontend.

The following variables need to be passed when running the middleware docker container:

* **-v** _/absolute_local_directory_path:/directory_path_on_image_

*  **-e mapping_spec_dir**  _Path in the docker container, including your custom mappings as defined on the right side of the volume parameter (`directory_path_on_image`) in the previous command. It can e.g be named to /mappings_


**Please note that `absolute_local_directory_path` has to be an absolute path in respect to the directory and operating system you are running the `docker run` command in.**

Here is an example of how we can mount a volume with the directory ```mappings``` when running ```docker run```:

`docker run -it -v //C/absolute_local_dir:/mappings -p 8080:8080   
-e mapping_spec_dir=/mappings -e hono.tenantId=your_tenantId -e hono.password=your_hono_password -e kinesis.streamName=mystreamName -kinesis.accessKey=mykey -e kinesis.secretKey=mysecret eclipsevorto/vorto-normalizer:nightly`
