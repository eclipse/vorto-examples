## Vorto Connector for Bosch Security Cameras

The Vorto Connector integrates Bosch Security Cameras with the Bosch IoT Suite. 
The following [Blog Post](https://blog.bosch-si.com/developer/avoid-tight-coupling-of-devices-in-iot-solutions/) gives a general overview about Vorto and this integration. 

In short, the connector processes Vorto Information Models to retrieve meta-data about the cameras on the one hand, as well as uses the [Vorto Mapping Engine](https://github.com/eclipse/vorto/tree/development/mapping-engine) to convert Camera Binary data to Vorto/Ditto compliant data.
