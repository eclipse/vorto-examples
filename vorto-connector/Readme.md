# Connecting Bosch Security Cameras to the Bosch IoT Suite 

This Vorto Camera Connector takes care of integrating Bosch security cameras with the Bosch IoT Suite. It essentially reads the camera's binary data, normalizes it to a semantic domain model and forwards this data to Bosch IoT Suite via MQTT. A solution can now easily read the camera data from Bosch IoT Things and process it.
The connector supports all cameras having people detection - and image-snapshot capabilities.
The capabilities are defined as Vorto Function Blocks.

The following 2 camera types are available in the Vorto Repository and work out-of-the-box with this connector. But it is very easy to plug-in other types of cameras and make it work with this connector (Please refer to section "Extending the Vorto Connector")

* [Flexidome Panoramic](https://vorto.eclipse.org/#/details/com.bosch.bt.camera:FlexidomePanoramic7000IC:0.0.2) 
* [Dinion](https://vorto.eclipse.org/#/details/com.bosch.bt.camera:DinionIPStarlight8000MP:0.0.1)

Here is a short youtube video about the integration: [Link to Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6m-6NMoN_Y&feature=youtu.be)

## Prerequisite

* [Bosch ID User Account](https://accounts.bosch-iot-suite.com)
* Subscription to Asset Communication for Bosch IoT Suite (Free plan, no credit card required)

* Tools
	* IDE
	* Git
	* Maven

* Hardware
	* Flexidome or Dinion Camera (providing image-snapshot and people detection cababilities)

## Steps to follow

This step by step explains how to connect a Bosch Flexidome camera to Bosch IoT Suite using this connector:

### Step 1: Register camera in the Bosch IoT Suite

Follow [this tutorial](https://github.com/eclipse/vorto/blob/development/docs/tutorials/create_thing.md) about how to register the device.

### Step 2: Configure the connector for your solution

1. Clone https://github.com/eclipse/vorto-examples.git
2. Check out branch **master**
3. Change to directory **vorto-connector/**
3. Open **application.yml** and add your Asset Communication package solution parameters, specifically for hono/hub:

		hono:
		  mqttEndpoint: ssl://mqtt.bosch-iot-hub.com:8883
  	  	  tenant: 
          registryEndpoint: https://manage.bosch-iot-hub.com
          registryUsername: 
          registryPassword: 
          devicePassword:     


### Step 3: Configure Connector for Flexidome Camera

1. Open Config Class **ApplicationConfiguration.java** and add the registered device ID as well as port of the camera.


		@Bean
		public SourceTracker sourceTracker() {
			SourceTracker sourceTracker = new SourceTracker();
			sourceTracker.addToTracker(SourceContext.newSource("DeviceID, as registered in Console, EG 62.4.2.1",10800));
			return sourceTracker;
		}

2. Download the Hub Server Certificate https://docs.bosch-iot-hub.com/cert/iothub.crt and store it under src/main/resources/certs/iothub.crt


### Step 4: Run the Connector

1. Run the application as a Spring Boot App

Once the app starts up, you should be able to see synchronization messages that reads the camera data and sends it to the Bosch IoT Suite every 5 seconds. 

### Step 5: Verify camera data in Bosch IoT Things

The easiest way to visualize the camera data, is to generate and download the [Vorto Web - Dashboard](https://github.com/eclipse/vorto/blob/development/docs/tutorials/create_webapp_dashboard.md).

## Extending the Vorto Connector 

The connector is currently limited to process only image- and object detection capabilities. 
This HowTo explains the necessary steps to "teach" the connector to process additional camera data.

### Prerequisite

* Github Account
* Camera API Specification Document

In short, these are the basic steps to add additional capabilities for the Flexidome Camera in the connector:

1. Create a new or re-use an existing Vorto Function Block which describes the capability and manage it in the Vorto Repository
2. Create a Vorto Mapping with target platform **BT_PLATFORM** , that maps the Camera API for this capability to the Vorto Function Block properties. Manage it in the Vorto Repository as well.
3. Reference the new Function Block from the [Flexidome Panoramic](https://vorto.eclipse.org/#/details/com.bosch.bt.camera:FlexidomePanoramic7000IC:0.0.2) Information Model.
4. Download the new Flexidome Mapping Specification from the Vorto Repository and store it in connector under _src/main/resources/mappings/FlexidomePanoramic7000IC.json_
5. Re-register the device in the Bosch IoT Suite
6. Run the Connector
